## ðŸ“‘ Permissions

This action needs a [**personal access token**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (with the _gist_ permission) in order to update gists.


## ðŸ“– Usage

### 1. Workflow Setup

#### 1. Gist Token

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` that comes with GitHub Actions by default, is restricted to the local repository. In other words, it _does not_ have permission to access GitHub Gists. You will have to provide a [**personal access token**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) (with the `gist` permission) as a secret.

1. Get a [personal-access-token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
1. Add it to your [repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) in the repo settings.
2. When you create the [workflow](#workflow), pass the secret in as the `GIST_TOKEN` environment variable.

```yaml
    env:
      GIST_TOKEN: ${{ secret.[SECRET_NAME] }}
```

#### 2. Gist

Note the `ID` of the gist you want to target. Create an new [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) if required.

> The `ID` is visible in the gist's url. `https://gist.github.com/<user>/<ID>`

The workflow takes a YAML input mapping gist-IDs to their corresponding files. e.g. to upload `README.md` to a gist with id `xyz123` you will provide the following input.

```yaml
with:
  gists: |
    - id: xyz123
      description: A test gist
      files:
        - README.md
```

> Note the `|`. It signifies that the input is a multiline string and not part of the workflow yaml.

#### 3. Workflow

Use this action in a workflow.

```yaml
- name: Gist-Mirror
  id: Gist-Mirror
  uses: Shresht7/Gist-Mirror@v1
  env:
    GIST_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GIST_TOKEN }}
  with:
    gists: |
      - id: bed31c34989a8ee63ec0dc4981a74c9c
        description: Gist-Mirror Action
        files:
          - README.md
          - .github/workflows/gist-mirror.yml
```

### On Push Trigger

You can use the on-push events to run the workflow automatically whenever commits are pushed to the remote repository.

Trigger when commits are pushed to the main branch

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```

or when commits affect certain files

```yaml
  on:
    push:
      paths:
        - README.md
        - httpStatusCodes.ts
```

Read more about [events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)

You can use these event triggers to run the workflow automatically whenever a file (that is to be mirrored to a gist) is changed.

To see a working example, see [Workflow Example](#-workflow-examples).

## ðŸ“‹ Inputs

<!-- slot: inputs  -->
| Input     | Description                                          |     Default | Required |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | ----------: | :------: |
| `gists`   | YAML mapping Gist IDs to their corresponding files   | `undefined` |     âœ…    |
| `dry-run` | No actual changes will be made if dry-run is enabled |     `false` |          |
<!-- /slot -->

### gists

The `gists` input takes in a YAML configuration mapping gist-ID to their corresponding files. You can specify multiple gist-IDs and multiple files.

```yaml
- id: gist_id_1
  description: single file gist
  files:
    - README.md

- id: gist_id_2
  files:
    - package.json
    - package-lock.json
    - .gitignore
```

### dry-run

If set to `true`, the action will not make any real changes and will only output logs.

## ðŸ“ƒ Workflow Example

To see a working example of this action, see this [workflow](./.github/workflows/gist-mirror.yml). This is the generated [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Shresht7/bed31c34989a8ee63ec0dc4981a74c9a).
